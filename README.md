## Modules
* [AO TempFiles Servlet](https://github.com/ao-apps/ao-tempfiles-servlet)

## Features
* Small and simple API for dealing with temporary files.
* Small footprint, self-contained, no transitive dependencies - not part of a big monolithic package.
* Java 11 implementation:
    * Android compatible.

## Motivation
The Java language has a long-term and [well-documented](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40119188/memory-leak-on-deleteonexithook) memory leak when using [File.deleteOnExit()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html#deleteOnExit()).  The [bug report](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-4872014) has been open for 14 years as of the time of this writing.

We desire to not have to choose between a memory leak and garbage files possibly left behind on shutdown, thus this API was born.

## Alternatives
There may be functionality that is also found in other projects.  Please let us know if you find a small, clean, focused alternative.  We always love to cure ignorance - especially our own.
